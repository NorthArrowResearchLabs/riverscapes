### July 30, 2020 -- data.riverscapes.xyz Launched!

Thank you for using the Riverscapes Data Warehouse. We appreciate how patient everyone's been while we're getting things going and sorting out the issues.

As of today we are moving out of Beta and launching the system at its final domain with a new, better login system and lots of little fixes and improvements.

We've upgraded our login system so **you will need to create a new account** to use the Warehouse at the new domain. Luckily, that's easier than ever now that we have 1-click **Google** sign-in. If you don't have a Google account then you can just use whatever email you have.

[Head over there now](https://data.riverscapes.xyz) to get your account in the new system and don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any issues.

Thanks,
